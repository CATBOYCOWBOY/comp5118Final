The 'flights' table has columns for 'Airline', 'FlightNo', 'SourceAirport', and 'DestAirport'. The 'airports' table has columns for 'City', 'AirportCode', 'AirportName', 'Country', and 'CountryAbbrev'.\n\nStage 3: Plan the SQL query structure\nTo retrieve the number of flights arriving in Aberdeen, we need to join the 'flights' table with the 'airports' table on the 'DestAirport' and 'AirportCode' columns.

The requirements are to use proper SQL syntax for SQLite and return only the final SQL query.\n\nStage 2: Examine the database schema and identify relevant tables and columns\nThe relevant tables are course, teacher, and course_arrange. The course table has Course_ID, Staring_Date, and Course columns. The teacher table has Teacher_ID, Name, Age, and Hometown columns. The course_arrange table has Course_ID, Teacher_ID, and Grade columns.\n\nStage 3: Plan the SQL query structure\nTo get the name of the teacher for the math course, we need to join the course and teacher tables based on their IDs and filter the results for the math course. We can use the course_arrange table to get the teacher ID for the math course.\n\nStage 4: Generate the final SQL query\nSELECT T1.Name FROM teacher AS T1 JOIN course_arrange AS T2 ON T1.Teacher_ID = T2.Teacher_ID JOIN course AS T3 ON T2.Course_ID = T3.Course_ID WHERE T3.Course = 'math'",

The song table contains information about the songs, including the singer who performed them.\n\nStage 3: Plan the SQL query structure\nTo find the most common singer citizenship, we need to:\n- Join the singer and song tables based on the Singer_ID foreign key\n- Group the results by citizenship\n- Count the occurrences of each citizenship\n- Identify the citizenship with the highest count\n\nStage 4: Generate the final SQL query\nSELECT Citizenship FROM singer GROUP BY Citizenship ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1",
